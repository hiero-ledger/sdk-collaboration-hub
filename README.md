## 🧭 Why This Repo Exists

This repo is **not**:

- A Hiero SDK codebase
- A replacement for official Hiero SDK documentation
- A place for implementation-specific issues

Instead, it is a **support system** for Hiero SDK contributors, meant to lower the barrier to entry, encourage high-quality contributions, and promote alignment across Hiero SDK implementations.

## Hiero SDK Call 
### What it is
The SDK Community Call is a bi-weekly (fortnightly) open gathering of developers, maintainers, and contributors working on the Hiero SDKs. It’s the ideal forum to:
- Share what you’re working on (new features, language-bindings, SDK performance, identity/VC flows etc.)
- Raise questions and discuss technical issues or design proposals
- Align across SDK stacks (Java, JavaScript/TS, Go, Rust, Python) and contribute to cross-cutting topics
- Build a stronger, more collaborative SDK ecosystem together
### Why attend
- Get visibility into what others are doing, avoid duplicate work, and discover opportunities to collaborate
- Contribute your ideas early and influence design decisions and roadmap priorities
- Connect with the maintainers and the broader community in a direct and informal setting
- Catch up on recordings if you miss a live call — they’re archived for reference
### When & how to join
- The meeting is scheduled at a regular cadence on Mondays (every two weeks) under the project’s community calendar. 
- To register for the call, please use the registration link on the LFX Calendar page for the SDK meeting series [here](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/94709702244-1762182000000/summaries?password=90c20c92-81b0-4c1e-b37c-2369fdc30cc3).
