## 🧭 Why This Repo Exists

This repo is **not**:

- A Hiero SDK codebase
- A replacement for official Hiero SDK documentation
- A place for implementation-specific issues

Instead, it is a **support system** for Hiero SDK contributors, meant to lower the barrier to entry, encourage high-quality contributions, and promote alignment across Hiero SDK implementations.

## 📞 Hiero SDK Community Call

The Hiero SDK Community Call is a recurring open meeting for developers, maintainers, and contributors working on the Hiero SDKs. It’s the main live forum to:

- Share what you’re working on (new features, language bindings, performance work, identity/VC flows, etc.)
- Raise questions and discuss technical issues or design proposals
- Align across SDK stacks (Java, JavaScript/TS, Go, Rust, Python, etc.) on cross-cutting topics
- Help shape a stronger, more collaborative SDK ecosystem

### Why Join?

- Stay informed about what other teams are building, avoid duplicate work, and spot collaboration opportunities
- Get early feedback on your ideas and influence design decisions and roadmap priorities
- Connect directly with maintainers and the broader community in a relaxed, discussion-friendly setting
- Catch up later via archived recordings if you can’t attend live

### When & How to Join

- The call runs on a regular cadence (currently every Monday) and is listed on the project’s community calendar.
