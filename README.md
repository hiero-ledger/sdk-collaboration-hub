## üß≠ Why This Repo Exists

This repo is **not**:

- A Hiero SDK codebase
- A replacement for official Hiero SDK documentation
- A place for implementation-specific issues

Instead, it is a **support system** for Hiero SDK contributors, meant to lower the barrier to entry, encourage high-quality contributions, and promote alignment across Hiero SDK implementations.
