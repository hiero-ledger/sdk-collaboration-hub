# HIP-1313: Enable a new high-volume entity creation option

HIP: https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1313

This HIP introduces **high-volume throttles**, a second set of limits for entity creation that sit alongside the existing standard throttles. Users can opt into these high-volume throttles by setting a boolean flag in their transaction, accepting dynamic pricing during busy periods to access additional capacity. The standard throttles remain unchanged with fixed prices, ensuring regular users experience no disruptions.

## Updated APIs

### Transaction

```
Transaction {
    // Set whether to use high-volume throttles for this transaction.
    // When true, enables high-volume throttles and pricing for entity creation.
    // Only affects supported transaction types; otherwise, it is ignored.
    Transaction setHighVolume(highVolume: boolean)
    
    // Get whether high-volume throttles are enabled for this transaction.
    boolean getHighVolume()
}
```

## Test Plan

### High-Volume Throttle Flag

1. **Given** an AccountCreateTransaction is configured with `setHighVolume(true)`, **when** the transaction is executed, **then** the account is created successfully using high-volume throttles.

2. **Given** an AccountCreateTransaction is configured with `setHighVolume(true)` and a valid `setMaxTransactionFee(fee)`, **when** the transaction is executed, **then** the account is created successfully and the fee charged respects the maximum transaction fee setting.

3. **Given** an AccountCreateTransaction is configured with `setHighVolume(true)` and a `setMaxTransactionFee(fee)` that is lower than the actual fee required, **when** the transaction is executed, **then** the transaction fails with an `INSUFFICIENT_TX_FEE` error.

## Examples

### Creating an Account with High-Volume Throttles

```javascript
import { AccountCreateTransaction } from "@hashgraph/sdk";

const accountCreateTx = new AccountCreateTransaction()
  .setKey(accountKey.publicKey)
  .setHighVolume(true)
  .freezeWith(client)
  .sign(accountKey);

const response = await accountCreateTx.execute(client);
const accountId = (await response.getReceipt(client)).accountId;
```
