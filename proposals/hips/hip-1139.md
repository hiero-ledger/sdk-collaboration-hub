# Hiero SDK Design Doc: Immutable Topic Ids and Updatable Submit Keys without an Admin Key

## Summary

See HIP-1139: [Enable Immutable Topic Ids and Updatable Submit Keys without an Admin Key](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals/blob/main/HIP/hip-1139.md)

The Hiero SDKs support this feature out of the box and require no additional implementation work. This document outlines only the integration tests and example usage patterns for the feature.

## Language
- "Dead Key" refers to an all-zeros Ed25519 public key that is cryptographically impossible to sign with.
- "Topic Immutability" refers to a state where both the Admin Key and Submit Key are unusable, ensuring no future modifications or operations are possible, but the Topic remains in Consensus Nodes (and block nodes in the future).

## Test Plan

1. **Given** a private topic is created with both an Admin Key and Submit Key, **when** the Submit Key is updated to a dead key using valid Admin Key signature, **then** no further messages can be submitted to the topic.

2. **Given** a private topic is created with both an Admin Key and Submit Key, **when** the Submit Key is updated to an empty key list using valid Admin Key signature, **then** messages can continue to be submitted without a submit key signature.

3. **Given** a private topic is created with both an Admin Key and Submit Key, **when** the Admin Key is updated to a dead key using valid Admin Key signature, **then** continue submit messages with the submit key and no further administrative updates can be made to the topic.

4. **Given** a private topic is created with both an Admin Key and Submit Key, **when** the Admin Key is updated to an empty key list using valid Admin Key signature, **then** continue submit messages with the submit key and no further administrative updates can be made to the topic.

5. **Given** a private topic is created with both an Admin Key and Submit Key, **when** both Submit Key and Admin Key are updated to dead keys with valid Admin Key signature, **then** the topic becomes fully immutable (neither messages nor administrative updates are possible).

6. **Given** a private topic is created with only a Submit Key and no Admin Key, **when** the Submit Key is updated to a dead key using valid Submit Key signature, **then** the update is successful and no more messages can be submitted.

7. **Given** a private topic is created with only a Submit Key and no Admin Key, **when** the Submit Key is updated to an empty key list using valid Submit Key signature, **then** the update is successful and messages can continue to be submitted without a submit key signature.

8. **Given** a public topic is created with an Admin Key but no Submit Key, **when** the Admin Key is updated to a dead key with valid Admin Key signature, **then** the topic becomes administratively immutable but still allows message submission.

9. **Given** a public topic with a Submit Key set to a dead key, **when** a message submission is attempted using the original Submit Key, **then** the submission fails with an invalid signature or unauthorized error.

10. **Given** a TopicUpdateTransaction attempts to update an Submit Key to a dead key without a valid Submit Key signature, **then** the update fails with an invalid signature.

11. **Given** a TopicUpdateTransaction attempts to update an Admin Key to a dead key without a valid Admin Key signature, **then** the update fails with an invalid signature.

12. **Given** a TopicUpdateTransaction attempts to update the Submit Key to a dead key with a valid Admin Key signature, **then** the update succeeds.

13. **Given** a TopicUpdateTransaction attempts to update the Submit Key from a dead key to a valid key with a valid Admin Key signature, **then** the update succeeds.

### TCK

Each of the above scenarios should be captured in the [Hiero SDK TCK repository](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-tck). Corresponding issues should be created for:

* Immutability transition coverage
* Signature enforcement on dead key updates
* Error handling when attempting to sign with dead keys
* Confirmation that irreversible state transitions behave as expected

## SDK Example

```javascript
import {
  Client,
  TopicCreateTransaction,
  TopicUpdateTransaction,
  PublicKey
} from "@hashgraph/sdk";

// Step 1: Create a topic with both Admin and Submit Keys
const topicCreateTx = new TopicCreateTransaction()
  .setAdminKey(adminKey.publicKey)
  .setSubmitKey(submitKey.publicKey);
const topicCreateResponse = await topicCreateTx.execute(client);
const topicId = (await topicCreateResponse.getReceipt(client)).topicId;

// Step 2: Make the Submit Key unusable by setting it to the dead key
const deadKey = PublicKey.fromBytes(new Uint8Array(32));
const updateSubmitKeyTx = new TopicUpdateTransaction()
  .setTopicId(topicId)
  .setSubmitKey(deadKey)
  .freezeWith(client)
  .sign(adminKey);
await updateSubmitKeyTx.execute(client);

// Step 3: Make the Admin Key unusable to make the topic fully immutable
const updateAdminKeyTx = new TopicUpdateTransaction()
  .setTopicId(topicId)
  .setAdminKey(deadKey)
  .freezeWith(client)
  .sign(adminKey);
await updateAdminKeyTx.execute(client);

// Step 4: Assert this topicId now represents a fully immutable topic
```
