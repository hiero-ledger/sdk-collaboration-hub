# 🧪 SDK V3 Sandbox

This folder contains all documents regarding a possible v3 of the Hiero SDKs.
Currently we want to test concepts for a future SDK version and will use this folder to share them.

## Draft of public API  

The [prototype-api](prototype-api) folder contains the draft of a possible public API for future SDK versions.
Parts of that API are not compatible with the current Hiero SDKs.
The goal of the draft is to define an ideal API for working with a Hiero based network.
Concerns about backward compatibility and migration workfklows are not part of the draft.
The draft is still work in progress and no API is fixed.

The API of V3 is defined by using our [API guidelines](../guides/api-guideline.md) for API additions in proposals.
By doing so we can specify the public API of a V3 SDK in an language independent way.

 ## Java PoC as base for the draft

 The [prototype](prototype) folder contains a Java based PoC that has been used as a base to get an understand of a possible V3 SDK.
 The PoC has been used as a base for the draft of the public API but has not been updated.
