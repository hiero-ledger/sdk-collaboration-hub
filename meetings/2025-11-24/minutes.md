## Minutes

- SDK Hacktoberfest follow-up
  - Rob recapped on Sophie's presentation last meeting and asked about follow-ups following her TSC presentation
  - Hendrik has had discussions with Richard about setting up GitHub actions and workflows in other SDK repositories
    - Also wanted to set up a weekly "backlog grooming" session to establish good first issues and clean up repos
      - Rob to reach out to Jessica about setting this up
  - Hendrik to meet with Sophie to bring workflows, GitHub actions, and trainings to LFDT
  - Sophie brought up again how contributors are starting to submit more complicated pull requests and it's becoming tougher to review them in a timely manner
    - Had to start asking Limechain to help review PRs
  - Hendrik mentioned he does not want people from Hashgraph and Limechain to take over the project
    - They could work on small portion of it, like TCK support
    - Wants to keep it a community project for the sake of having it as a good example of a fully open-source project
  - Hendrik suggested having more Hashgraph and Limechain engineers do reviews in the Python SDK, not full implementations
  - Hendrik also mentioned trying to acquire money and resources to do things like training videos
  - Rob clarified that all this was meant to be general SDK training, not Python specific
  - Rob suggested trying to find a better spot to put this information (SDK hub?)
    - Hendrik agreed but should figure out resourcing and money first
- v3 Keys
  - Rob recapped previous discussion on keys for v3 SDK and presented on what our current SDKs are capable of
    - Described ASN.1, DER, PKCS#8, X.509 SPKI, and SEC1 standards and how they applied to the SDKs
    - Highlighted differences between the SDKs in terms of key format, and import and export capabilities
    - Key highlights:
      - ED25519 key generation is fully standardized across Hiero SDKs
        - Private keys use PKCS#8 standard
        - Public keys use SPKI with curve-OID
      - ECDSA secp256k1 has two camps
        - Camp A
          - C++, Swift, JS, Rust
          - Private keys use PKCS#8
          - Public keys use SPKI with curve-OID and compressed EC point
        - Camp B
          - Java, Go, Python
          - Private keys use SEC1 ECPrivateKey
          - Public keys use SPKI with id-ecPublicKey + params and compressed EC point
            - Python uses uncompressed EC point
      - In general, there still is a good amount of cross-compatibility between SDKs, but they're not fully cross-compatible
        - Some SDKs can't import keys from other SDKs
    - Suggested use of PKCS#8 for private key and SPKI with curve-OID going forward as standard
  - Hendrik and Rob agreed a unified structure should be thought up (i.e. all keys in all SDKs use the same ASN.1 structures)
  - Keith expressed concerns in this simplicity, thinking there would be no good way to import all possible standard keys into the SDK
    - Rob reassured that most modern crypto libraries should be able to parse most standard ASN.1 key definitions
      - If an SDK is unable to right now, it is most likely at the SDK level that is preventing it
  - Rob mentioned he wasn't sure if these differences are SDK level differences in implementations, or lower-level crypto library implementations
    - Hendrik stated we should look into the lower-level library implementations and see what they can support
  - Keith questioned if we even needed DER-encoding in SDKs as the web3 space doesn't use DER-encoding
    - Hendrik mentioned we could make it more obvious in SDKs, doing something like `fromStringEthereum` for other web3 users
    - Rob stated DER-encoding, while not as necessary in web3 space, is a good way to interface with other libraries or non-web3 systems
